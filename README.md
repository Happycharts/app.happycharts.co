Welcome to Happybase, the fair-source data commercialization platform built to enable enterprise teams to build hosted data sharing portals using tools like Notion and Hex while monetzing their data via Stripe Connect. 

### ðŸ¤” Why tho?

While Happybase in many ways is a simple tool, the commercialization it enables and the flexibility it provides is what makes it so powerful. We also believe that the value compared to other alternatives is bar-none. When we started Happybase, we had a few goals in mind:

- **Build something that is easy to use and maintain.**
- **Build a platform that is so flexible it can be used for applications even outside data sharing.**
- **Provide users with a way to commercialize their data without having to commit a huge portion of their ACV to a data sharing platform.**

Happybase is built around a few key concepts that make it a powerful and secure data-sharing platform. These concepts include IFrame Portals, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and a Semantic Layer. Letâ€™s dive into each of these components to understand how they work together to create a robust and user-friendly platform.

### ðŸ¤“ How does it work?

The internals of Happybase are built around a few key concepts:

- **IFrame Portals**: Happybase uses IFrames to create a secure data sharing environment for your customers.
- **JWT**: JWT is used to authenticate and authorize users to access data.
- **Semantic Layer**: Semantic layer is used to create a data sharing layer that is easy to understand and use.
- **Stripe Connect**: Stripe Connect is used to enable users to monetize their data.

#### Commerce: Stripe Connect

Stripe Connect is used to enable users to monetize their data. Stripe Connect is a powerful tool that allows users to connect their Stripe account to their Happybase account. This allows users to monetize their data by charging a fee for access to their data.

- **Account Setup:** Users can easily set up a Stripe Connect account through the Happybase platform. This account will be used to manage all financial transactions related to data sharing.
- **Payment Processing:** When a user purchases data or access to a portal, Stripe Connect handles the payment processing. This ensures that transactions are secure and compliant with global payment standards.
- **Payout Management:** Stripe Connect also manages payouts to data providers. Users can set up automatic payouts to their bank accounts, ensuring they receive their earnings promptly and securely.
