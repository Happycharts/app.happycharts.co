### ðŸ¤” Why tho?

We built Happybase as a response to closed tools like [Prequel](https://www.prequel.co/) and [Census Embedded ETL](https://www.getcensus.com/embedded) that go so far as even requiring a direct and raw data connection to your data warehouse. We believe that data should be shared, but we aren't fans of the approach that allows any customer to run a `SELECT * FROM table` query against your data.

Our approach stands out by using client-side data sharing and sementic layer tools which have built in security contexts such as Cube to enable data sharing without exposing your data to the world. By using a client-side data sharing approach along with JWT, we can ensure your ability to share data on your terms while still allowing your customers to access the data they need.

### ðŸ¤“ How does it work?

The internals of Happybase are built around a few key concepts:

- **IFrame Portals**: Happybase uses IFrames to create a secure data sharing environment for your customers.
- **JWT**: JWT is used to authenticate and authorize users to access data.
- **Semantic Layer**: Semantic layer is used to create a data sharing layer that is easy to understand and use.
